How to Use This Script

Save the Script: Copy and paste the code into a file named monitor.sh.

Make the Script Executable: Run the following command to give execution permissions:

bash

chmod +x monitor.sh

Run the Script:

bash

./monitor.sh


Scheduling with Cron

To automate this script to run at specific intervals, you can add it to your crontab:

Open the crontab editor:
bash

crontab -e
Add a line like the following to run the script every hour:
bash

0 * * * * /path/to/monitor.sh >> /path/to/logfile.log

This script will display real-time system stats every time you run it, and you can modify it to log data to a file or schedule regular monitoring with cron.
